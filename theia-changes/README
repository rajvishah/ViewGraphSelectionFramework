What is this library?
---------------------

Theia is an end-to-end structure-from-motion library that was created by Chris
Sweeney. It is designed to be very efficient, scalable, and accurate. All
steps of the pipeline are designed to be modular so that code is easy to read
and easy to extend.

Please see the Theia website for detailed information, including instructions
for building Theia and full documentation of the library. The website is
currently located at http://www.theia-sfm.org
